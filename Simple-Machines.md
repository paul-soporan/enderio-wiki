# Simple Machines

*Simple Machines are cheaper versions of Ender IO's starting machines.*

***They must be used to advance to the next tiers.***

They are cheaper, but are less capable, slower, hold less energy, don't respond to redstone signals, and most slowly leak excess energy.

**Tip:** A [[Basic Capacitor Bank|Capacitor-Banks#basic-capacitor-bank]] doesn't require any alloys to craft, can limit its output, and reacts to a redstone signal.

**It can be used to mitigate energy loss.**

## Simple Stirling Generator
![](renders/simple_stirling_generator.png)

Simple version of the [[Stirling Generator]].

**It burns furnace fuels to generate power.**

It has an efficiency of 80%.

It generates 30 µI/t and produces 12 µI per unit of burn time (1 Coal produces 19,200 µI).

It holds up to 2,000 µI, but leaks 1 µI/t.

**It is unable to use Lava Buckets.**

## Simple Alloy Smelter
![](renders/simple_alloy_smelter.png)

Simple version of the [[Alloy Smelter]].

*Unlike the normal Alloy Smelter, it cannot be used as a vanilla furnace* (a [[Simple Powered Furnace|#simple-powered-furnace]] must be used instead).

**It can only make Alloys.**

It uses 15 µI/t when running, stores up to 2,000 µI, but leaks 0.05 µI/t constantly.

## Simple Powered Furnace

**It smelts items.**

It uses 15 µI/t when running, stores up to 2,000 µI, but leaks 0.1 µI/t constantly.

## Simple SAG Mill
![](renders/simple_sag_mill.png)

Simple version of the [[SAG Mill]].

**It is unable to use Grinding Balls.**

It uses 15 µI/t when running, stores up to 2,000 µI, but leaks 0.05 µI/t constantly.

## Simple Wired Charger
![](renders/simple_wired_charger.png)

Simple version of the [[Wired Charger]].

**It charges items.**

*Its GUI has 2 slots to charge µI items and allows quick access to the Armor, off-hand, and Baubles slots.*

It uses 30 µI/t when running, stores up to 2,000 µI, but leaks 0.05 µI/t constantly.

**Unlike the other Simple Machines, it CAN be controled by redstone.**

## Simple Crafter
![](renders/simple_crafter.png)

Simple version of the [[Crafter]].

**It crafts items.**

It uses 2 µI/t when running, 10 µI/t per craft, and and stores up to 10,000 µI.

*Unlike the other Simple Machines, it does not leak power.*
