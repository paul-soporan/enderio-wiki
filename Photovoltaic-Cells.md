# Photovoltaic Cells

**Photovoltaic Cells generate power from sunlight.**

*They can connect horizontally as a free-form multiblock.*

The amount of power they generate vary throughout the day, maxing out around noon.

*They must have a clear line of sight to the sky.*

There is a config option which determines if Photovoltaic Cells of different tiers can connect, in `config/enderio/enderiomachines.cfg`: `solar { B:canSolarTypesJoin=false }`

In the 1.12 and the 1.7 versions they default to not allowing them to connect to different tiers.

In 1.10 they default to allowing them to connect.
