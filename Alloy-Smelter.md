# Alloy Smelter
![](renders/alloy_smelter.png)

**Used to create EnderIO [[Alloys]].**

*Can also be used as a powered furnace capable of processing up to three items at a time.*

There is a button in the GUI that can toggle the Alloy Smelter between `All Smelting`, `Alloys Only`, and `Furnace Only`.

*For this machine to work, you **have to** insert a [[Capacitor|Capacitors]].*

Higher Level Capacitors increase speed and energy storage.

Speed is directly related to µI/t.

| Capacitor Level               | µI/t | Buffer (µI) |
| :---------------------------- | ---: | ----------: |
| 1 (e.g. Basic)                |   30 |     100,000 |
| 2 (e.g. Double-Layer)         |   90 |     300,000 |
| 3 (e.g. Octadic)              |  150 |     500,000 |
| 4 (e.g. Melodic)              |  240 |     800,000 |
| 5 (e.g. Stellar)              |  390 |   1,300,000 |
| 6 (e.g. Efficiency V Totemic) |  540 |   1,800,000 |
