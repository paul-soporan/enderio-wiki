# Lava Heat Exchanger
![](renders/lava_generator.png)

**Generates energy by cooling down Lava.**

*Make sure it doesn't overheat!*

Can be cooled by placing cold fluids or ice around it.

Redstone Mode and Side IO can be configured.

*For this machine to work, you **have to** insert a [Capacitor|Capacitors]].*

Higher level capacitors increase the energy production rate (ÂµI/t) and the efficiency.
